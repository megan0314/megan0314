        <p>The goal of "Dead Ahead" is to collect all the coins in order to go to<br>
        the next level. Avoiding the zombie is obviously the main goal. Touching<br>
        the zombie once makes you lose one life. 3 total lives are given. If all<br>
        three of the lives are gone, the game will be over. Dead Ahead was  inspired<br>
        by Plants vs Zombies and Super Mario. The game was successful in it's appearance<br>
        and the movement of the main character. There was difficulty in the disappearance<br>
        of the sprites when the green flag is clicked. If I had more time, I would have<br>
        made the game more possible to win, make the backdrops nicer, and fix the<br>
        scoring of the game because it was supposed to change backdrops when the lives<br>
        are lost, but sometimes the game goes to negative lives and the game just breaks<br>
        down. Algorithms found in this game are the collection of coins.</p>

        <P>This choose-your-own adventure story is based off of the Chinese Drama<br>
        "Love O2O". A girl named Weiwei plays a game called "A Chinese Ghost Story"<br>
        and has multiple choices of either choosing her soulmate or even dying alone.<br>
        Based off of the choices given, three different outcomes are possible.</P>

        <p>Personally, I thought that the story was quite easy to make. The story<br>
        that my partner and I made had a plot since it was based off of a drama.<br>
        The coding was quite simple and straightforward, considering the fact that<br>
        the teacher provided the code for us to copy and paste. All my partner and<br>
        I needed to do was word out our flow map and make decisions for the reader.<br>
        The only difficult part was creating the different outcomes to the story.<br>
        I particularly enjoyed Boku No Hero because of how detailed it was. <br>
        Comparing it to my story, it was long and very novel-like.</p>
