        <p>The goal of "Dead Ahead" is to collect all the coins in order to go to<br>
        the next level. Avoiding the zombie is obviously the main goal. Touching<br>
        the zombie once makes you lose one life. 3 total lives are given. If all<br>
        three of the lives are gone, the game will be over. Dead Ahead was  inspired<br>
        by Plants vs Zombies and Super Mario. The game was successful in it's appearance<br>
        and the movement of the main character. There was difficulty in the disappearance<br>
        of the sprites when the green flag is clicked. If I had more time, I would have<br>
        made the game more possible to win, make the backdrops nicer, and fix the<br>
        scoring of the game because it was supposed to change backdrops when the lives<br>
        are lost, but sometimes the game goes to negative lives and the game just breaks<br>
        down. Algorithms found in this game are the collection of coins.</p>
